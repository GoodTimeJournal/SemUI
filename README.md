## This project is a Web App based on the award winning course and bestseller book 'Designing Your Life' 
The purpose of this app is to help users create the best life for themselves whether it'd be in career or personal relationships etc. This app guides users into utilizing the award winning techniques from the course day by day in a time efficient fashion. 

### In this part of the project 2 web pages were built with a few interactive components for users and fully responsive for tablet and mobile devices.  
1. Landing Page for the marketing website and web app
 ...This page used HTML/CSS for structure and styling. For interactivity JavaScript, DOM manipulation, reusable class components were used. 
2. A 'Further Reading' webpage under the 'Features' tab from the navigation menu (Because self-help goes hand in hand with self-education). This section of the webpage equips users with actionable education in a very time efficient manner of 10-15 minutes per day
 ...This page used several features of Bootstrap to create the structure and user interactivity.
